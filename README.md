# DS102.P21_Lab_2
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of student dropout and their academic success based on various factors such as their background, academic record and so on. By building a predictive model, this project aims to provide actionable insights for educational institutions to identify at-risk students and intervene early, improving retention rates and student outcomes.
